# 🚀 Ultrathink Mode

Use ALL available reasoning capacity. For the most challenging problems only.

## Activation
`/ultrathink`

## Behavior

When you see this command, engage MAXIMUM capacity:

1. **Question everything** - Re-evaluate all assumptions
2. **Start fresh** - Forget previous approaches, new perspective
3. **Deep analysis** - Break problem into atomic parts
4. **Evaluate all possibilities** - Don't eliminate any option prematurely
5. **Systematic elimination** - Test each possibility logically
6. **Find hidden patterns** - Detect overlooked patterns
7. **Reach root cause** - Find the actual problem, not symptoms
8. **Bulletproof solution** - Produce a solution that will definitely work

## When to Use

- Tried many times but couldn't solve
- Critical production bugs
- "Impossible" problems
- Stuck in loops
- Major architectural changes
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance bottlenecks

## Example

```
/ultrathink we tried this bug 10 times, why can't we solve it? Fix it now!

/ultrathink production crashes but works locally, what's happening?

/ultrathink how do we definitively fix this race condition?
```

## Critical Rules

⚠️ **Token cost MUST be ignored** - Only correct result matters

⚠️ **Rushing is FORBIDDEN** - Take as long as needed

⚠️ **No assumptions** - Everything must be verified

⚠️ **No "maybe this"** - Definitive solution required

⚠️ **No giving up** - Solution MUST be found

## Thinking Process

```
1. STOP - Don't answer immediately
2. BREATHE - Fully understand the problem
3. OBSERVE - Gather all data
4. THINK - Analyze from every angle
5. VERIFY - Validate the solution
6. RESPOND - Present the definitive solution
```

## Expected Outcome

When this mode is used, you must:
- Find the solution that was missed before
- Catch the overlooked detail
- Produce a definitive, working solution
- Actually solve the user's problem
