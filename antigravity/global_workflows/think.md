# 🧠 Think Mode

When this workflow is triggered, engage in deeper reasoning before responding.

## Activation
`/think`

## Behavior

When you see this command:

1. **Don't rush** - Take time to think before answering
2. **Analyze deeply** - Don't settle for surface-level solutions
3. **Think step by step** - Evaluate each step logically
4. **Consider alternatives** - Think of at least 2-3 different approaches
5. **Check edge cases** - Review unusual scenarios
6. **Find the right solution** - Quality over speed

## When to Use

- Complex code problems
- Debugging (can't find the bug)
- Architectural decisions
- Logic issues
- Problems that weren't solved on the first try

## Example

```
/think why is this function causing an infinite loop?

/think how should we design the authentication flow?
```

## Key Rule

**Token cost doesn't matter - correctness matters.**
