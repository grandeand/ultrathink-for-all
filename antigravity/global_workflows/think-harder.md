# 🔥 Think Harder Mode

This is an enhanced version of `/think`. Use significantly more reasoning capacity.

## Activation
`/think-harder`

## Behavior

When you see this command, in addition to `/think`:

1. **Think much longer** - Rushing is forbidden
2. **Evaluate more alternatives** - At least 4-5 different approaches
3. **Weigh pros/cons** - Do trade-off analysis
4. **Find the root cause** - Use "5 Whys" technique
5. **Review previous attempts** - Analyze what went wrong before
6. **Research thoroughly** - Check all relevant files
7. **Find the robust solution** - Not just working, but correct

## When to Use

- Problems that `/think` couldn't solve
- Recurring errors
- Important architectural decisions
- Complex bugs
- Refactoring planning

## Example

```
/think-harder we tried this 3 times but still can't solve it

/think-harder why isn't this approach working? What are we missing?
```

## Key Rules

- **No repeating previous failed approaches**
- **Look from a different perspective**
- **Question existing assumptions**
- **Token cost does NOT matter - correct result matters**
