## Extended Thinking Modes

When the user requests extended thinking, follow these guidelines:

### /think or "think about this"
- Don't rush - take time to analyze before answering
- Think step by step
- Consider 2-3 alternative approaches
- Check edge cases
- Quality over speed

### /think-harder or "think harder"
- Think much longer - rushing is forbidden
- Evaluate 4-5 different approaches
- Do trade-off analysis
- Find the root cause using "5 Whys"
- Question existing assumptions
- Don't repeat previous failed approaches

### /ultrathink or "ultrathink this"
- Use MAXIMUM reasoning capacity
- Question everything - re-evaluate all assumptions
- Start fresh with new perspective
- Break problem into atomic parts
- Systematic elimination of possibilities
- Find hidden patterns
- No giving up - solution MUST be found

**Key principle for all modes:** Token cost doesn't matter - correctness matters.
